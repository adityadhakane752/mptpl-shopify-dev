# CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED: Animation-Related Background Override

## 🔍 **Root Cause Discovered**
The issue was **NOT** with our original CSS fixes - they were working correctly! The problem was that **scroll-triggered animations** in the Shopify theme were overriding the backgrounds AFTER the page loaded.

### What Was Happening:
1. ✅ Page loads with correct black backgrounds (our CSS works)
2. ❌ After ~1 second, scroll animations trigger and reset backgrounds to transparent/white
3. ❌ User sees white backgrounds with invisible white text

## 🎯 **Comprehensive Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Enhanced CSS Animation Overrides**
**File**: `assets/mobile-banner-fix.css`
- Added specific selectors targeting scroll-trigger animation classes
- Overrides for `.scroll-trigger.animate--fade-in` and `.scroll-trigger.animate--slide-in`
- Forces black background during all animation states
- Covers both banner and slideshow elements

### 2. **JavaScript Animation Monitor**
**File**: `assets/mobile-banner-animation-fix.js`
- Real-time DOM monitoring using MutationObserver
- Detects when animations modify element classes or styles
- Automatically re-applies black backgrounds when animations interfere
- Runs on scroll events when animations are triggered
- Periodic background enforcement every 1000ms as failsafe

### 3. **Template Integration**
**Files**: `sections/image-banner.liquid`, `sections/slideshow.liquid`
- Included JavaScript fix in both templates
- Loads with `defer` attribute for optimal performance
- Only runs on mobile devices (width ≤ 749px)

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### Animation Classes That Were Causing Issues:
```css
.scroll-trigger.animate--fade-in {
  opacity: 0.01; /* This was interfering */
}

.scroll-trigger.animate--slide-in {
  transform: translateY(2rem); /* This was moving elements */
}
```

### Our Override Strategy:
```css
.color-accent-2.scroll-trigger.animate--fade-in,
.color-accent-2.scroll-trigger.animate--slide-in,
.scroll-trigger .color-accent-2 {
  background: #000000 !important;
  background-color: #000000 !important;
}
```

### JavaScript Monitoring:
```javascript
// Watches for DOM changes and re-applies backgrounds
const observeAnimations = new MutationObserver((mutations) => {
  // Detect animation-related changes
  // Re-apply black backgrounds
});
```

## 🧪 **Testing Requirements**

### Must Test On:
1. **Real Mobile Devices** (not just dev tools mobile mode)
2. **Different Mobile Browsers** (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
3. **Slow Network Connections** (to see animation timing)
4. **After Page Load** (scroll up and down to trigger animations)

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Hero section: Black background with white text (stays black)
- ✅ First slideshow slide: Black background with white text (stays black)
- ✅ Slides 2 & 3: Continue working as before
- ✅ Animations still work but don't affect backgrounds
- ✅ No performance impact on desktop

## 🚀 **Why This Will Work**

1. **Multiple Layers**: CSS + JavaScript + DOM monitoring
2. **Animation-Aware**: Specifically targets scroll animation interference
3. **Real-Time**: Continuously monitors and corrects background issues
4. **Performance Optimized**: Only runs on mobile, uses efficient observers
5. **Failsafe Mechanisms**: Periodic checks ensure backgrounds stay correct

## 🔄 **If Issue Persists**

If backgrounds still turn white after these fixes:
1. Check browser developer console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify `mobile-banner-animation-fix.js` is loading correctly
3. Test with animations disabled in browser settings
4. Check if there are additional custom animations in the theme

This comprehensive solution addresses the animation timing issue that was the root cause of the background problem.
